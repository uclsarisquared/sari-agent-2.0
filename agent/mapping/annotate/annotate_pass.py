"""The annotation pass: turn a directory of captured checkpoint images into durable, queryable
map annotations. This is the write side Phase 3 item 8 called for - the piece between "the model
can read a shelf" (the probes) and "we have a queryable map" (this).

Deliberately OFFLINE. capture_walk.py already drove the sim and saved one PNG per checkpoint;
this reads those PNGs and the frozen topology, runs the two-stage VLM annotation, and writes the
results. No sim, no re-walk - so prompts and models can be iterated freely without re-driving the
store, and a good capture set is annotated as many times as it takes to get the prompts right.

Two stages per checkpoint, exactly as annotator_sys_inst.effective_kind() defines:
  * A kind="shelf" checkpoint (geometry says "a shelf might be here") is CLASSIFIED first from its
    primary image - shelf vs. bare wall. ~40% are walls by construction, and a wall annotated as a
    shelf would get "list the products" pointed at nothing. The classifier is the filter.
  * The effective kind (topology kind reconciled with the classifier verdict) picks the Stage-2
    overlay: the shelf overlay enumerates items; the non-shelf overlay describes the spot and is
    forbidden from inventing products.

Three outputs, one per job the design assigns (see plans/phase3.1_semantic_product_layer.md):
  * annotations_<tag>.json - the per-checkpoint sidecar, keyed by checkpoint id. The machine record:
    every checkpoint's effective kind, classifier label, and full annotation. Written incrementally
    after each checkpoint, so an interrupted pass keeps what it finished and --resume continues it.
  * products_<tag>.json - the ONE flat product index. Every item from every shelf, each row tagged
    with its checkpoint_id. This is what answers "find and pick up Pepero" without the agent
    knowing Pepero's category or checking each checkpoint. No dedup, no merge tier - two shelves
    holding Pepero are two rows, and the agent picks the nearest (the flat-index decision).
  * semantic_map_<tag>.txt - a first-cut rendered document in the shape of agent's
    semantic_memory.txt: per-checkpoint prose from the VLM, plus connectivity and facing taken from
    the graph (never the VLM - the graph owns spatial truth). The assembler, not a writer.

Backend is annotate_claude_cli (claude -p on the claude.ai / Max-plan login). Swap --model /
--effort to compare; the prompts and schema are the same ones the probes use.

    (shelf_coverage.find_landmark_checkpoints) only proposes structures NO checkpoint observes, and
    on every fresh explore since 07-24 the shelf sweep reads the checkout counter itself (a shelf
    node stands at its face), so the counter is eroded as "observed" and the graph gets NO landmark
    from geometry - runs 0731_* shipped with no checkout node at all, which breaks go_to_counter /
    the whole place subtask. Five geometric discriminators were tried and failed (see the
    DEFAULT_LANDMARK_MIN_FREE_PERIMETER docstring in shelf_coverage for the list); the signal that
    IS stable is semantic: the annotator reads the kiosk's "Welcome to Self Checkout!" signage at
    that node on every run. So: the VLM judges what is in front of it (this), the graph owns where
    it is (the node's existing cell/shelf_cell/neighbors are untouched).

    A promoted record's effective_kind becomes "landmark", which makes the node a routable
    destination for route hints and walk_map, and StoreMap.counter_checkpoint() finds it by
    topology kind. interaction_xz (the cp54-style dock pose) is computed from grid_final.npy via
    the same dock walk the geometric pass uses; best-effort - the drive/align primitives
    (go_to_counter, align_to_scanner) need only kind + shelf_cell, not the dock pose.

    Same-structure guard: if the topology already has a landmark whose shelf_cell is within 1.0m
    of this node's (the frozen baseline, where the geometric pass found the counter itself), skip -
    one checkout, one landmark. A landmark FARTHER away does not block promotion on purpose:
    run_0724's pre-existing false landmark faces a wall corner 1.5m off, and the real counter must
    still be promoted alongside it.
