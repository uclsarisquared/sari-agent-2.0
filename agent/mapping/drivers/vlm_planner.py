"""VLM navigation planners.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
CLAUDE.md's governing principle - "the graph owns spatial truth; the VLM only judges what is
directly in front of it" - rests on a claim NavReasonPlan.md asserts but never measured:

    "Navigation is the primary failure mode of the agent: it collides with walls, takes
     suboptimal paths, and the VLM wastes its reasoning budget on global path planning it
     fundamentally cannot do from a first-person view. The root cause is that no component
     has a global view of the store."                              - NavReasonPlan.md:5

That last sentence is exactly why the claim cannot be cited as evidence for A* as it stands. It
attributes the failure to MISSING INFORMATION (no global view), not to the VLM's spatial reasoning.
An examiner can fairly reply: of course a blind navigator loses to one holding a map - that
compares "map" against "no map", not "A*" against "VLM". Confounded, and proves nothing.

So this module deliberately refuses to build the strawman. The VLM planner here is handed STRICTLY
MORE information than A* ever gets:

  * the same OccupancyGrid A* plans on, rendered top-down as an image (walls, free space, unknown)
  * the SAME grid again as a coarse ASCII map, because a text grid sidesteps the vision encoder's
    downscale entirely (see the resolution trap in `render_map_png`)
  * every frontier cluster's exact world (x, z), size, distance and relative bearing, as text -
    so it never has to visually localise a target to aim at one
  * its own pose, and the running history of where its own proposals got blocked
  * the first-person camera view - information A* has no way to consume at all

and is asked for EXACTLY the contract A* satisfies: the next straight-line-reachable waypoint
toward a frontier. Same inputs (plus extras), same output type, same safety layer, same
termination rule, same loop. Only the planner object differs.

If the VLM still underperforms under those conditions, "it just needed the map" is no longer an
available objection, and the measured gap is attributable to the spatial reasoning itself. If it
does NOT underperform, that is a genuine finding too, and better learned here than at a defence.

WHAT IS MEASURED, AND THE ONE METRIC THAT MATTERS
-------------------------------------------------
Every proposal is validated against the grid and recorded, never silently corrected - correcting it
would launder the failure this exists to quantify. The decisive metric is `crosses_occupied`:
the straight segment from the agent to the VLM's waypoint passes through cells the grid ALREADY
knows are occupied. A* cannot emit such a waypoint - `simplify_path`/`_line_of_sight` structurally
forbid it - so this is a clean, quantitative statement of "proposed a route through a known wall,
while holding a map of that wall." It is the number to put in the thesis.

Nothing here can drive the agent into a shelf: explore.py's `swept_clearance_ahead` LiDAR cap
applies identically to both arms and is what actually keeps the body safe. A bad waypoint therefore
costs a wasted/blocked step, not a collision - which is precisely what makes it measurable.

DELIBERATE FAIRNESS CHOICES (all reversible, so the generosity itself is testable)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * Frontier detection is SHARED, not reimplemented: both arms call grid.frontiers() +
    cluster_frontiers() with the same parameters. The contested claim is about navigation, so
    frontier *detection* must not be allowed to vary between arms.
  * Termination is SHARED: a run ends when no clusters remain / max_steps / the same circuit
    breaker. The model's own `exploration_complete` is advisory and only LOGGED (as
    premature_done). If it ended runs, the arms would stop on different criteria and their
    coverage numbers would not be comparable - and "it quit at step 3" would waste a live run.
  * The VLM is re-asked every step by default (--vlm-replan-every 1): maximum responsiveness, and
    the most expensive setting. Cost is reported honestly rather than bought with capability.
  * On an unusable reply we retry, then coast on the last good waypoint, then hold. We NEVER fall
    back to A* - that would contaminate the arm being measured.

MEASURED SERVER LESSONS INHERITED FROM annotate_probe.py - do not re-litigate
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * Schema MUST be sent as `response_format`. This vLLM build SILENTLY IGNORES `guided_json`,
    and silently is the whole problem: the prompt alone already yields conforming JSON, so an
    ignored schema is indistinguishable from a working one until you negative-control it.
  * `enable_thinking` defaults OFF. A measured probe run spent its entire token budget reasoning,
    looped, and never reached an answer. The schema does the structuring instead; the `reasoning`
    field below captures the model's own stated rationale in one short string (which is also the
    qualitative evidence worth quoting in the writeup - the model narrating why it is about to
    walk into a shelf).

    backend for the whole run (Agg, or an interactive one under --show-map). Going through pyplot
    here would fight that choice and could silently break --show-map; this path renders off-screen
    without touching global backend state either way.

    RESOLUTION TRAP (measured, see CLAUDE.md): the fridge annotation failure was ultimately
    effective resolution after the vision encoder's downscale - not the prompt, not the model. The
    same trap applies here. A 60m grid at 0.1m is 600x600 cells; once the encoder downsamples it,
    a 0.3m aisle gap can vanish into a smear, and the model would then be failing at PERCEPTION,
    not at spatial reasoning - which would confound exactly the thing this measures. Two
    mitigations: frontier coordinates are also given as exact text (so no target ever has to be
    visually localised), and the ASCII map carries the same occupancy at a resolution the encoder
    cannot touch. --map-crop-m is available if a zoomed local view is wanted, but it is off by
    default because cropping removes the global view and would re-introduce the very confound

    perception failure, per the resolution trap in render_map_png). A text grid removes that

        the body safe, so a bad waypoint is paid for in a wasted step, not a collision.

        TWO STANDARDS, REPORTED SEPARATELY - collapsing them would overclaim
        --------------------------------------------------------------------
        `_inflate_occupied` marks every cell within body_radius of an obstacle, which is the
        standard A* itself plans against, so it is the fair like-for-like comparison. But a cell
        inside that margin is NOT necessarily a cell the map calls solid, and a metric named as
        though it were would not survive scrutiny:

          *_inflation  - the agent's body cannot occupy this / the swept body clips an obstacle.
                         The apples-to-apples number: exactly what A* is forbidden to emit.
          *_obstacle   - the cell (or the line) is literally recorded as occupied in the grid.
                         Strictly stronger, and un-arguable: this is a wall on the map.

        A measured subtlety that makes `into_obstacle` rare and easy to misread: LiDAR rays stop
        at a shelf's FACE, so a shelf's interior is never observed and stays `unknown` (log_odds
        0.0), not occupied. A waypoint placed deep inside a shelf therefore does NOT trip
        into_obstacle - it trips into_inflation (near the face) while sitting in nominally
        "unknown" space. The line from the agent to it still crosses the face, so
        crosses_obstacle is the flag that catches it, and crosses_obstacle is accordingly the
        headline number for the writeup: the straight route passes through cells the map records
        as solid.

    """--planner vlm-advised: the VLM still owns every decision; A* whispers.

    The fourth arm on the authority spectrum, between `vlm` (no help) and `vlm-goal` (A*
    executes). Each ask, A*'s OWN best move from the current PARTIAL map - nearest reachable
    frontier by path cost, first simplified waypoint - is computed and injected into the
    prompt as an explicitly ADVISORY line. The VLM may follow or override; nothing is
    validated differently, nothing is corrected, and the executor still never falls back
    to A*.

    Why this arm exists (see phase4.1 doc, "vlm-advised"):
      * It is the MOST generous baseline constructible: map + coordinates + THE ANSWER. If
        the model still proposes waypoints that cross recorded walls, no examiner can say
        the setup starved it. If it executes faithfully, that measures the ceiling.
      * During EXPLORATION the advice is computed on an incomplete grid, so it can be
        genuinely wrong in ways the first-person camera can catch. A deviation with a clean
        flag set is the camera-override result - the one regime where VLM-in-the-loop could
        legitimately beat pure A*, and the only honest reason to keep a VLM in the loop.

    Attribution rule, load-bearing: read `advice_agree`/`advice_deviate` TOGETHER with the
    waypoint flags. Agree-rate ~1.0 with clean flags = A* with a VLM latency tax. Deviations
    with clean flags = camera overrides worth reading individually. Deviations WITH flags =
    the thesis claim, now with the answer having been handed over.

    On the FROZEN map this arm is pointless by construction - A* is near-perfect there, so
    the VLM can only match it (tax) or deviate (worse). It belongs to the exploration
    harness only; keep it out of the Phase 4.2 task-navigation A/B.
