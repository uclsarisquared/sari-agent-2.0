The result's `hand` field says which hand grabbed. Works ONLY in *manipulation* mode - the hands are inactive in perception/navigation mode, so calling it there does nothing. It does NOT aim and does NOT move the body, so centre the item first; if it reports gripped=False the item was out of reach - move the body closer, then RE-CENTER (center_object_on_screen) before retrying.\n"

    "checkout_held_item: Emit THIS to check out the item(s) you are holding in ONE deterministic step - it drives to the self-checkout counter, squares onto the scan pad, scans, and bags in the tray. When you are carrying items in BOTH hands, this ONE action checks out both in a single pass: it scans the left item, scans the right item, then bags them both (you do NOT call it twice). When only one hand holds, it checks out that item. Do NOT hand-sequence the driving / aligning / scanning / placing yourself - this single action does all of it (times value is ignored). Works ONLY in *manipulation* mode, and ONLY when the CURRENT GOAL is a checkout/scan-and-bag subtask - if your goal is merely to pick something up, do NOT check out; finish by emitting STOP and a later agent handles the checkout. Afterwards, read `last_checkout` in the state: STOP only once it shows scanned AND placed; if it did not scan or bag, re-emit checkout_held_item or reposition per its reason. Use checkout_held_item_left / checkout_held_item_right only if you need to check out ONE specific hand's item on its own.\n"

# Held-item inspection is a restricted macro like the grab tool. The actor cannot choose rotations,
# presentation, grip changes, checkout, camera actions, or body motion while an item is held.
INSPECTION_ACTIONS = (
    "inspect_held_item: Run the complete restricted held-item inspection loop (times is ignored). The tool auto-selects a held hand, preferring LEFT when both hands hold items. Use a hand-specific variant when the inspection request targets one of two held items. It presents the item and uses a fresh isolated VLM visibility check for legibility plus a separate fresh label-presence check. Each search pass performs eight X turns of exactly 45 degrees followed by deterministic Y turns that check the top and bottom. Rotation stops only when the requested Nutrition Facts/expiration label is directly front-facing, not merely readable at an angle. That side then stays facing the camera while the hand moves 5 cm closer at each remaining stage, up to five total distance stages; PaddleOCR reads a centered item crop at every locked stage and its lines are supplied as auxiliary evidence. The actor cannot choose or sequence rotations. Read last_inspection: label_legible=true means read the exact requested values from the CURRENT screen, using ocr_lines as supporting text, and STOP. best_effort_read=true means the label is locked at the closest position but remains formally illegible; nevertheless use both the CURRENT screen and ocr_lines to transcribe the best answer possible and STOP. Do not call the macro again on that same hand's item in either case; when two items must be compared, call the OTHER hand's variant next, since only one item can face the camera per run and each read is remembered in inspection_evidence. sweep_exhausted=true means no requested directly front-facing label was found after all five search sweeps.\n"
