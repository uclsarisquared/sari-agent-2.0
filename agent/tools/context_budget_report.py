"""Where the agent's context window goes, measured off saved bench runs.

Reproduces the context-bloat analysis end to end and sizes each ablation arm, so the decision to
cut (or keep) a context component is made against numbers rather than intuition. Offline: reads
`bench_runs/` only - no sim, no sandbox lease, no model call.

WHAT IT MEASURES, AND WHY THE MODEL EXISTS
    The per-step prompt is not one blob: the actor, the semantic learner and the episodic learner
    each assemble their own, and only some parts grow with the step index. Total input tokens fit

        tokens_in  ~=  A * steps  +  B * sum_k(k)

    where `sum_k(k)` is the accumulated conversation depth over a leg (step 1 pays for 0 prior
    turns, step 30 pays for 29). A is the flat per-step cost - system prompts, the rendered store
    map, the findings context, this step's frames. B is the COMPOUNDING term, and it is the one
    that decides whether a 100-step leg is affordable. The fit runs over every attempt in the
    corpus and reports R^2, because the whole argument rests on B being real.

    Attribution of B to individual components is DERIVED, not metered: the runs in `bench_runs/`
    predate `token_meter`'s per-role accounting, so the script measures every text component it
    can read from the step dumps and attributes the residual to the retained screenshots. When a
    run DOES carry `by_role` (anything metered after roles landed), the script reports it and
    checks the model against it instead of guessing - see `role_attribution`.

CHARS-PER-TOKEN
    Text sizes are measured in characters and converted with CHARS_PER_TOKEN, a rough constant for
    English prose + JSON. It is a scaling factor on every text-derived number here, so it cancels
    out of the SHARES (which arm is worth testing) and only matters for the absolute token counts.
    `--chars-per-token` overrides it; `by_role` supersedes it entirely once available.
