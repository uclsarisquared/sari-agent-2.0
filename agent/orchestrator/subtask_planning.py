"""subtask_planning.py - Phase 6.3 plan-time map planning for the long-horizon orchestrator.

Lightweight and sim-free (like subtask_completion.py): no torch/agent/env imports, so the planning
logic is offline-unit-testable in milliseconds (importing subtask_agents pulls the whole model stack).
The map resolver (locate_task) is imported LAZILY inside the resolve helpers, and every function takes
the StoreMap `sm` as a parameter, so this module itself pulls nothing heavy at import.

What lives here (Phase 6.3 #1/#3):
  - plan_legs():  resolve each pickup/goto/compare target to checkpoint(s) ONCE, at plan time, so the
                  completion predicates get real checkpoints, a doomed plan is caught early, and the
                  graph navigator can reuse the candidates instead of re-resolving at runtime.
  - order_legs(): reorder INDEPENDENT (pickup -> checkout) pairs nearest-first by graph hops.

Location naming stays SEMANTIC end to end: the decomposer emits names ("the checkout counter", product
names), never checkpoint ids; the resolver owns name->checkpoint. One source of truth for spatial facts.
