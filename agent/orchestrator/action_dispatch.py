    crouch, re-center, re-measure, grab if now reachable, and ALWAYS stand back up (finally-guarded).

    Posture is deliberately NOT the VLM's job: if standing up were left to the actor, a run could end
    with the agent navigating crouched (or the learner drawing lessons from a stale posture). The
    invariant this enforces: **the agent is only ever crouched inside a single grab call** - the same
    scoping the hand-retract already uses. Measured basis (envelope.csv, 2026-07-22): L1 items missed
    standing at slant 1.1-1.3 m and grabbed crouched at 0.6-0.7 m - crouching shortens the slant
    distance below max_reach.

    The re-center is MANDATORY: crouching drops the camera ~0.7 m, so the just-centred target is now
    well off-centre; grabbing without re-centering is the grab-the-neighbour failure. Hands stay
    ACTIVE throughout (Phase 6.1: hands are always-on at REST/GRAB; centring already runs with resting
    hands everywhere else). If after crouching the target is STILL too far, we stand up and report the
    measured move - the tool never moves the body (2026-07-21 directive); the router moves and the
    next grab re-crouches (one spare cycle, rare)."""
