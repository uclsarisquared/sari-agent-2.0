"""subtask_completion.py - typed-subtask contract + pluggable pickup completion predicates.

Lightweight and sim-free BY DESIGN: no torch/agent/env/openai imports, so the offline predicate
tests and the decomposer A/B harness load in milliseconds (importing subtask_agents pulls the whole
model stack, ~25 s). subtask_agents.py imports the loaded prompt export, parser, and predicates FROM
HERE; the prompt text itself lives in ``agent/prompts/orchestrator/decomposer.md``.

The default pickup, compare, and unknown guards remain deterministic. An optional VLM backend may
inject per-hand pickup verdicts, a labeled multi-frame compare verdict, or a current-frame unknown
task verdict, while every inspect leg requires its own image-bound VLM verdict. Deterministic
physical and structural prerequisites remain additive. A VLM `STOP` is still only a *request* these
predicates grant or refuse.

Type vocabulary is CLOSED: pickup | checkout | compare | goto | inspect. An untypeable decomposition degrades
to `unknown`, which falls back to the pre-6.3 keyword guards (behaviour preserved, logged as
`untyped`). `checkout` REPLACES the master plan's `place`: 6.2 collapsed scan-then-bag into the one
deterministic macro `store_map.checkout_held_item`, whose measured `{scanned, placed}` verdict the
checkout predicate reads rather than re-deriving.

# --- catalog grounding (2026-07-23) -----------------------------------------------------------
# Two catalog sources, both LAZY + FAILURE-SILENT by design (a machine without them degrades to the
# plain substring check, keeping this module sim-free and import-cheap):
#   1. Categories.json - the full category->SKU index (all ~250 SKUs). Path comes from
#      $SARI_SANDBOX_DIR (config.env; see sim.sim_paths) - there is no path to the separate sim repo
#      that works across machines, so it is read as a setting rather than hardcoded per-developer
#      (the previous absolute broke on every machine but the one it was written on, silently, into
#      this same failure-silent fallback - see agent/CLAUDE.md open thread on catalog grounding).
#      Gives BOTH category membership (a 'Biscuits' target -> any Biscuit SKU) AND the set of
#      category-name words, which are GENERIC (see below).
#   2. products_final_shelf_reconciled.json - the annotated per-SKU records (~56 SKUs) carrying a
#      clean NAME + VARIANT + APPEARANCE. Used to ENRICH the held item's identity text: the raw sim
#      SKU string is munged ('JACK_AND_JILL_PIATTOS_...'), the reconciled name is clean ('Piattos').
#      APPEARANCE (colour/packaging) rides along as a SOFT, ADDITIVE tie-breaker - it can only HELP a
#      target token match (e.g. 'green Piattos' vs a 'green bag' appearance), never block one, so the
#      78% of SKUs with no record never cause a false refusal.

                            # "sim repo present" (e.g. a test's skip guard) should check this flag.

# A size/pack token ('70g', '500ml', '5x18g') is a spec, not identity - matching on it alone is as
# weak as matching on a category word, so it is treated generic too. Pure-digit brands ('555') are
# NOT size tokens (no unit), so they stay distinctive.

# Colloquial words the store catalog has no clean category/token for -> the specific SKUs they name,

# Each key is merged into the lexicon as a pseudo-category AND marked generic, so a BARE alias target
# ('cereal') resolves to its SKU list while a NAMED product still wins on its own distinctive token
# ('Coco Pops' -> coco_pops). Lists are kept TIGHT (only true members) so an alias can never grant a
# neighbour that merely shares a broad category - it does NOT alias to a whole loose category.

#               refused): no cereal SKU contains "cereal"; all six are filed under Biscuit by brand.
#   candy /   - both alias the eat-as-is chocolate BARS (Schogetten, Lindt, M&M, Kinder Tronky - a
#   chocolate   choco wafer bar, counted here per user call 2026-07-24). 'candy' matched 0 SKUs;
#               'chocolate' matched 21 across 4 categories as a FLAVOR word - the alias TIGHTENS it to
#               the bars, while a choco-flavored biscuit still matches on its brand ('Pocky chocolate').
#   cheese    - dairy cheese only (Eden, Magnolia Cheezee/DailyQuezo). 'cheese'/'cheesy' is a flavor
#               across Chips/Can/Nuts (19 raw matches); a flavored snack still matches on its brand.
#   yogurt    - Cimory, Dutchmill Proyo, Pascual Greek, Bauer FruFru. Dutchmill *Delight* (cultured
#               milk, not yogurt) is deliberately OUT.
