"""place_probe.py - interactive centre-LiDAR probe + place-envelope calibration (Phase 6.2). 🎮

The sibling of reach_probe.py, for RELEASING onto the checkout counter instead of grabbing off a
shelf. Grab an item to carry, drive it to the counter, centre the counter surface, then release from a
RANGE of distances and record whether the item landed ON the surface (judged by eye per trial - there
is no sim query for "is item X on surface Y", and honest eyes beat an unverified heuristic). Needs the
sim in Play mode on ws://localhost:8080.

    python place_probe.py

WHY a separate envelope (do NOT reuse the 0.85 m reach number): grabbing needs the HAND to reach the
item; placing needs the released item's FALL to intersect the surface. Different physics, different
number - and placing may care about release HEIGHT too (too high a drop can bounce/roll off), which is
why `c` (crouch) and the standing/crouched posture column are here. If height matters, a distinct
PLACE pose earns its existence over reusing GRAB (phase6 plan, "The place envelope - measured").

Commands at the `>` prompt (a trailing number is a repeat count, default 1):
  <Enter>        re-read the centre LiDAR + save a crosshair screenshot (surface distance/height/gap)
  counter        drive to the checkout counter via go_to_counter (the SAME deterministic tool the
                 agent uses - A*-drive + face cp54, carry-safe), then re-read. This is the realistic
                 arrival pose; sweep standoffs from HERE with w/s.
  goto N         drive to any checkpoint N (A*-drive + face) - e.g. to a shelf to grab, before `counter`
  center [y]     run center_to_counter (the FIXED-input centring variant), then re-read. Optional
                 y (0-1) overrides the VERTICAL aim for this call: the detector boxes the WHOLE
                 counter (front face included), so its bbox centre maps to a 3D point near the
                 top's FRONT EDGE - releases there roll off. y > 0.5 parks the bbox lower in
                 frame, so the centre ray (and the release) lands DEEPER on the surface. Dial y
                 until the crosshair sits mid-surface; the winning value gets PINNED into
                 perception.COUNTER_AIM_NORM (it is provisional for exactly this reason).
  scanner [y]    run center_to_scanner (the scan-pad sibling of `center`), then re-read. Optional
                 y (0-1) dials the vertical aim exactly like `center [y]`; the winning wording/aim
                 get PINNED into perception.SCANNER_TARGET_INFO / SCANNER_AIM_NORM. (probe M2)
  align [N]      lateral-align loop from cp54 (probe M4, the Option A prototype): centre the pad,
                 read the yaw error vs cp54's perpendicular, re-face the perpendicular, strafe
                 slant*sin(yaw_off) out, re-centre; at most N iterations (default 3). Prints the
                 residual per iteration - the number that decides Option A vs a spliced scan dock.
  adv [T]        approach until the centre-ray slant ~ T metres (default SCAN_REACH_M), re-centring
                 the SCANNER after each move - the "scan region within the hand's max reach" step;
                 the centre-LiDAR slant is the ONLY distance the gate uses (probe M3: does a sweep
                 from inside SCAN_REACH_M scan? no boundary-mapping ladder needed)
  sweep [label]  in-hand scan sweep (probe M1): requires HOLDING. GRAB pose, extend FULLY toward
                 the pad (the stall guard / Unity clamp stops the hand - there is NO stop-distance
                 calibration: the Easy trigger box covers the whole scan region, so a full
                 extension transits it), retract + REST. The grip is NEVER opened. Then it centres
                 the POS screen and region-OCRs its bbox for a NEW receipt line (scanned_measured),
                 AND asks YOU (scanned_verified) - both logged to scan_probe.csv, never promoted.
  screen         centre the POS screen + region-OCR its bbox, print every line (probe M5: is the
                 receipt OCR-able from here? does not disturb the sweep's receipt baseline)
  w N | s N      move forward | backward  N steps (0.1 m each), then re-read  (fine standoff sweep)
  a N | d N      move left | right        N steps
  j N | l N      pan  left | right        N (2.5 deg each)
  i N | k N      tilt up   | down         N
  c              toggle crouch, then re-read (tests whether a LOWER release lands better)
  g [label]      GRAB an item to carry (raw extend_arm_until_grabbed; sets GRAB, reaches, restores REST)
  p [label]      PLACE from here: extend the hand forward over the surface, release, then log the row
  pr [label]     PLACE at REST (release without extending) - A/B whether the forward reach matters
  gp <label> [T] AUTO macro (the whole 6.1+6.2 chain, no LLM): grab the item you're centred on
                 (or use the one you're already holding) -> go_to_counter -> center (2 retries) ->
                 auto-approach until the centre-ray slant ~ T metres -> center again -> drop -> ask
                 landed -> log. T defaults to TIGHTEN_TARGET_M; pass it to sample a chosen distance,
                 e.g. `gp 7 1.55` then `gp 8 1.35` to BRACKET the far boundary in two commands.
  x              release the left grip WITHOUT logging (abort a carry / reset)
  ?              reprint this help
  q              quit (stands the agent back up)

MANUAL RUN: `goto <shelf-cp>` -> `g <item>` -> `counter` -> `center` -> `p <item>`; then `s`/`c` to
sweep standoff and posture. AUTO RUN: centre on a shelf item, then `gp <item> [T]` does the rest -
repeat with different T to tighten the envelope fast.

SCAN RUN (6.2 restructure, probes M1-M5): carry an item in (`goto` + `g`, or be holding), `counter`,
then `scanner` (M2 - iterate the wording/aim until the pad locks), `align` (M4), `adv` (M3 - close
until the pad slant is inside SCAN_REACH_M), `sweep <label>` (M1 - full-extension in-hand sweep;
verifies via the POS-screen bbox OCR AND your eye). `screen` reads the receipt in its own bbox (M5).
There is NO drop-scan variant: the item never leaves the hand between shelf and tray. M7 (tray far
bound) stays on the old path: `gp <label> 1.35` / `1.45` / `1.55`.

A read prints, e.g.:
  [standing] dist=0.71m pitch=+34.0 cam_h=1.31 -> surface_h=0.91 fwd_gap=0.59 hit=True  [read_007.png]
surface_h is the counter-top world Y under the crosshair; fwd_gap is the horizontal distance to it.
hit=False means nothing solid at frame centre (looking PAST the counter / at the floor) - re-centre.

CALIBRATION RECIPE - carry an item in with `g`, `center` on the counter, then `p <label>` from a
range of standoffs (start at the cp54 dock ~0.20 m and back off with `s` until releases stop landing),
a couple at crouch to check height. Each `p` asks you by eye whether it LANDED, and logs
(slant_distance, pitch, camera_height, surface_height, landed). Then fit the boundary the same way
reach did (fit_envelope.py pattern) and wire it into plan_place. The columns that decide it are
`slant_distance` and `landed`; if crouched rows land where standing rows didn't at the same distance,
that is height mattering - split out a PLACE pose.
