"""Watcher tests: scanning, collapse detection, discovery, and the HTTP surface.

Entirely offline - no sim, no coordinator, no model stack. The fixtures write the same artefacts a
real battery does (attempt.json, legNN.jsonl, legNN/stepNN.png, summary.json), so the scan path is
exercised against the real shapes rather than a mock. What is being pinned down:

  1. a healthy attempt scores clean while a looping one scores as a collapse, and tiles sort
     worst-first - the ranking IS the feature;
  2. discovery picks the newest battery, and --run-dir pins one;
  3. an attempt whose runner died shows as orphaned rather than as a live tile frozen forever, can
     be closed out into a real recorded attempt, and is never confused with whoever inherited its
     pid - while a runner that is only slow to finalize still gets the last word;
  4. the HTTP API serves state/frames/logs, and path traversal in an attempt key is refused;
  5. a rotated-aside requeue dir does not merge with the attempt that replaced it;
  6. every halt is announced exactly once whatever its outcome, and carries a replay clip inside the
     upload budget - written beside, never over, the dashboard/CLI replay.mp4;
  7. a watcher restart does not replay finishes that predate it into the channel;
  8. a human verdict is offered only where the AGENT chose to halt, is stored beside `success` and
     never over it, and reaches attempts.csv blank - not False - where nobody has looked;
  9. the dashboard renders and serves a seekable replay clip with Discord switched off entirely.

The Discord tests stub `_post` rather than the socket, except for one that stands up a throwaway HTTP
sink to pin the multipart body: that encoding is the part a wrong guess would break silently.
