"""Wire protocol shared by the coordinator, the benchmark runner, and the Unity sandbox.

Every message is a JSON object with a ``type`` field. The Unity side of this contract lives in
``Assets/Scripts/SocketServers/DistributedBench/BenchCoordinatorClient.cs`` - keep the two in step.

Two routes on the coordinator:

``/sandbox``  sims register and stay connected
    sandbox -> coord   sandbox.hello, sandbox.heartbeat, sandbox.state
    coord -> sandbox   coord.welcome, coord.lease, coord.reset, coord.release

``/bench``  one connection per benchmark worker, at most one lease each
    bench -> coord     bench.acquire, bench.release, bench.status, bench.capacity
    coord -> bench     bench.lease, bench.released, bench.pool, bench.capacity,
                       bench.sandbox_lost, bench.error
