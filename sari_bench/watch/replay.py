"""Renders an attempt's replay clip, and optionally posts it to Discord.

This is a worker thread rather than a call inside the watcher's diff, for two reasons.

* **The diff runs on an HTTP handler thread.** `WatchState._notify` is reached from `GET /api/state`,
  so an inline ffmpeg pass over a few hundred frames would hang the dashboard - the very thing you
  opened to find out what the fleet is doing - for as long as the encode takes.
* **One worker means one encode at a time.** The watcher usually shares a host with the runner and its
  agent subprocesses. A battery where eight attempts finish together must not answer with eight
  concurrent ffmpeg processes competing with the agents still running.

The queue is bounded and every failure is swallowed: a halt is always announced, with the clip if there
is one and without it if the render did not work out.

Two kinds of job share the one worker, because both reasons above apply to both:

* **announce** - a halt was detected, render a clip and post it. Rendering is best-effort.
* **render** - an attempt finished (or a reviewer requested an older replay). Nothing is posted; the
  clip lands in the run dir and `GET /api/attempt/<key>/replay.mp4` serves it on the next poll.

Rendering is therefore enabled independently of Discord: the dashboard's verdict flow needs the
encoder with no webhook configured at all.
