"""Turns a battery output directory into a live view of the fleet, by reading only the filesystem.

The runner and the agents already write everything a dashboard needs, and they flush as they go:

    bench_runs/<battery>/battery.json          the battery's plan (denominators)
    bench_runs/<battery>/attempts.jsonl        canonical finished-attempt index
    bench_runs/<battery>/<prompt>/try<NN>/
        attempt.json                           this attempt's manifest, incl. pid and deadline
        agent.log                              the agent's stdout
        summary.json                           written at exit
        legNN.jsonl                            one flushed record per step
        legNN/stepNN.png                       the frame that step saw

So the watcher never talks to a runner or an agent, and nothing it does can perturb a battery that
is six hours in. It also means the whole module works retroactively on old run dirs.
