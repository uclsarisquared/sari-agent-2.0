"""Discord webhook notifications, driven off the watcher's poll loop.

This lives in the watcher rather than the runner on purpose. The runner is a scheduler: giving it an
outbound HTTP dependency puts a network call on the path that releases a lease. The watcher already
computes health, already sees the whole battery, and is the one place that can hold cooldown state -
so it is where notification belongs.

Everything here is best-effort and swallows its own errors. A webhook that 429s, a DNS failure, or
a missing URL must never disturb the poll loop, let alone a battery.

Configure with SARI_BENCH_DISCORD_WEBHOOK in config.env (or the environment).
