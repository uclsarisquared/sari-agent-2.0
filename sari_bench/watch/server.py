"""The live benchmark dashboard: `python -m sari_bench watch`.

Runs beside the RUNNER, not the coordinator. Screenshots and step logs are written by agent
subprocesses the runner spawns, so they are on the runner's local disk; the coordinator is allowed
to be a third machine entirely.

It reads the filesystem, and optionally opens ONE read-only connection to the coordinator's /bench
route to show the sandbox pool. That connection only ever sends `bench.status`, never
`bench.acquire`, so it cannot take a lease away from a worker.

Stdlib only - ThreadingHTTPServer plus one HTML file, polled. This is a handful of tiles refreshing
every couple of seconds; it does not warrant a web framework, and pyproject.toml is deliberately
kept to what is actually imported.

        The verdict is stamped BESIDE `success`, never over it: a measured pass with a verified fail
        is exactly the discrepancy worth collecting, and overwriting `success` would erase it.

        "invalid" writes no `verified_success` at all - the reviewer is saying the run never tested
        anything, usually because the harness broke, so neither True nor False is an honest answer
        and a reader with no notion of the third verdict must fall back to "unreviewed" rather than
        to "failed". It also cancels no siblings: an excluded try leaves the prompt undecided, and
        the remaining tries are exactly what still has to run.

        "already_successful" is excluded on the same terms and writes no boolean either, but says
        something different: the try was halted because another try of this prompt had already been
        judged a success. It is not evidence about the agent in either direction, and it cancels
        nothing - whatever cancelling was warranted was done by the pass that caused the halt.
