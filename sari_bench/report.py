"""Flattens a battery into CSVs: ``python -m sari_bench report``.

Three files, not one. Attempts, legs and per-role token spend are different grains - an attempt has
a variable number of legs and a variable set of reasoners, so folding them into one row either
truncates or explodes, and neither pivots. They all join on ``run_dir``.

``roles.csv`` is long-format on purpose (one row per attempt PER ROLE, not one column per role):
that is what makes "tokens by arm by role" a two-click pivot, and it means a reasoner added or
removed agent-side changes the row count rather than the header - so an old CSV and a new one still
stack.

Both inputs are written incrementally (the canonical ``attempts.jsonl`` index as attempts finish,
each attempt's own ``summary.json`` at its exit), so this is runnable mid-battery and a battery
interrupted after six hours still reports.
